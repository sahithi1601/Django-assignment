Question 2: Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

step 1: Define the Model and Signal (models.py)

import threading
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

class TestModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=TestModel)
def signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal Handler Thread ID: {threading.get_ident()}")

Step 2: Run a Test in Django Shell

from myapp.models import TestModel
import threading

print(f"Caller Thread ID: {threading.get_ident()}")

# Creating an instance to trigger the signal
TestModel.objects.create(name="Test Entry")


Expected Output

Edit
Caller Thread ID: 140485967943424
Signal Handler Thread ID: 140485967943424
